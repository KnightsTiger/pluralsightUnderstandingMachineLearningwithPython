# 1.We can check is that supervised or unsupervised
# 2.Classification or regression 
# 3.Make the algo simple

# Now we can select the suitable algo
# In this case we can select following algo

# 1. Navie bayes
# 2. Logistic regression
# 3. Decistion Treee

# Navie bayes algo - based on the likelyhood of the probablity. In this case every feature has same weight. 
    # Hence we need only small amount of data to train

# Logistic regression - This returns a binary result
    # The relationship between features are weighted.
    # Resultant value is mapped between 0 and 1 (This is equalant to true and false in this example)

# Decision tree
    # This uses a binary tree
    # Decision based on the node values
    # This needs a lot of data to find the correct path
